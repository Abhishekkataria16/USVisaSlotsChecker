## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Required
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-email-password
RECEIVER_EMAIL=recipient@email.com
API_KEY=your-checkvisaslots-api-key

# Optional
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
PROXY_IP=your-proxy-ip
PROXY_PORT=your-proxy-port
PUSHOVER_TOKEN=your-pushover-token
PUSHOVER_USER=your-pushover-user
VISA_CONSULATE_LOCATIONS=NEW DELHI
VISA_VAC_LOCATIONS=NEW DELHI VAC,MUMBAI VAC,KOLKATA VAC
VISA_DURATION_DAYS=120
```

## Installation & Deployment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd us-visa-slot-checker
```

2. Create and configure the `.env` file with your settings

3. Build and start the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Check the logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## How It Works

1. The script runs every 3 minutes via cron
2. It checks for available slots at configured consulate and VAC locations
3. When slots are available at both a consulate AND a VAC location within the configured time window:
   - Sends an email notification
   - Sends a Pushover notification (if configured)
4. The script converts all timestamps to IST for easier tracking
